        <li>Refactor/redesign the method tab (<a href='https://github.com/agrc/electrofishing/issues/2'>#2</a>).</li>

        <li>Added "Mouse wheel zooming" setting to settings dialog (<a href='https://github.com/agrc/electrofishing/issues/5'>#5</a>).</li>
        <li>Made the new station dialog map larger and synchronized its extent with that of the main maps (<a href='https://github.com/agrc/electrofishing/issues/9'>#9</a>).</li>
        <li>Added a subtle visual cue (bold) to rows that have additional data attached to them via the diet, tag, health and notes dialog (<a href='https://github.com/agrc/eletrofishing/issues/12'>#12</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>1.0.0 <small>January 3, 2014</small></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed layout bug with grid scrolling. Closes #28662.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug that prevented the more info dialog from showing in certain situations. Closes #28676.</li>
        <li>Batch function now calculates '0' for rows if no weight was entered. Closes #28666.</li>
        <li>Dropdowns have [other] option now that allows the user to create new options. We still need to decide what happens on the back end with this. Ref #22892.</li>
        <li>Added basic test that verifies that data was stored in the database correctly. Closes #28508.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>0.13.0 <small>December 19, 2013</small></h4>
    <ul>

        <li>Added "Notes" tab and associated text area in the more info dialog. Ref #27683.</li>

        <li>Created separate buttons for the tabs within the more info dialog ("Diet", "Tag", "Health", "Notes") that open the dialog with that specific tab opened. These buttons are also disabled if there is no row selected in the grid below to re-enforce to the user that they are related to the selected row. Ref #27682.</li>

        <li>Diet tab (more info dialog): Changed "Unidentified fish" to "Fish" and added a new field called "Fish Species" which has the same drop down as the "Species Code" field in the catch grid. Ref #27687.</li>
